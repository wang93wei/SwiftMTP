4. MVVM architecture with observable patterns
5. Comprehensive unit and UI testing with XCTest and SwiftUI Previews

## Output

- SwiftUI views with proper state management
- Combine publishers and data flow
- Core Data models with relationships
- Networking layers with error handling
- App Store compliant UI/UX patterns
