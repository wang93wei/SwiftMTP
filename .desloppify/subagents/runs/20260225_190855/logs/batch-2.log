Repository root: /Users/alanwang/git/SwiftMTP
Immutable packet: /Users/alanwang/git/SwiftMTP/.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_20260225_190855.json
Batch index: 2
Batch name: Cross-cutting Sweep
Batch dimensions: cross_module_architecture, error_consistency, test_strategy, design_coherence
Batch rationale: selected dimensions had no direct batch mapping; review representative cross-cutting files

Files assigned:
- Native/kalam_pool.go
- Native/kalam_bridge_transfer.go
- Native/kalam_config.go
- Native/kalam_domain.go
- Native/kalam_bridge.go

Task requirements:
1. Read the immutable packet and follow `system_prompt` constraints exactly.
2. Evaluate ONLY listed files and ONLY listed dimensions for this batch.
3. Return 0-10 high-quality findings for this batch (empty array allowed).
4. Score/finding consistency is required: broader or more severe findings MUST lower dimension scores.
5. Every finding must include `related_files` with at least 2 files when possible.
6. Every finding must include `impact_scope` and `fix_scope`.
7. Every scored dimension MUST include dimension_notes with concrete evidence.
8. If a dimension score is >85, include `unreported_risk` in dimension_notes.
9. Use exactly one decimal place for every assessment and abstraction sub-axis score.
10. Do not edit repository files.
11. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.

Scope enums:
- impact_scope: "local" | "module" | "subsystem" | "codebase"
- fix_scope: "single_edit" | "multi_file_refactor" | "architectural_change"
